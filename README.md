## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Management

Performance tuning (for smoothest gameplay)

- Lower the resolution for best FPS:
	- `SCREEN_RES=1280x720` (default) or `SCREEN_RES=1600x900` for a balance of quality and speed.
- Increase VNC cache for noVNC/x11vnc fallback:
	- `N_CACHE_SIZE=200` (default)
- TurboVNC JPEG quality and compression:
	- `TURBOVNC_JPEG_QUALITY=90` (default, max 100)
	- `TURBOVNC_COMPRESSION=0` (default, 0=best quality, 9=smallest bandwidth)

Example for fastest, smoothest experience:

```bash
SCREEN_RES=1280x720 N_CACHE_SIZE=200 TURBOVNC_JPEG_QUALITY=90 TURBOVNC_COMPRESSION=0 docker compose up --build -d
```

In the noVNC web UI:
- Click inside the window to enable pointer lock (mouse capture for Minecraft/Lunar).
- Use Chrome/Chromium for best performance.

If you want to experiment, try lowering `SCREEN_RES` further or increasing `TURBOVNC_JPEG_QUALITY` for sharper visuals.

Change screen resolution

You can control the virtual display size with environment variables. By default the container now uses 1920x1080x24. To override when starting with docker-compose:

```bash
# start with a 1280x720 display
SCREEN_RES=1280x720 SCREEN_DEPTH=24 docker compose up --build -d
```

2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8080/vnc.html`.

3. If Prism Launcher did not download at build time, copy the AppImage into the running container or into `data/` before starting:

```bash
# download locally and copy into container
wget -O PrismLauncher.AppImage "<url-from-github-release>"
docker cp PrismLauncher.AppImage novnc-ubuntu:/home/developer/PrismLauncher.AppImage
docker exec -it novnc-ubuntu chown developer:developer /home/developer/PrismLauncher.AppImage
```

4. From the noVNC desktop, open a terminal and run:

```bash
./PrismLauncher.AppImage
```

Troubleshooting server connection

- If the Minecraft client inside the container cannot connect to a server running on your host machine, use `host.docker.internal` as the server address (Docker maps this to the host gateway):

```text
server address: host.docker.internal
port: 25565
```

- Quick in-container test (run in a terminal inside the noVNC session):

```bash
# check DNS/resolution
getent hosts host.docker.internal

# test TCP reachability to a Minecraft port on the host
bash -c 'cat < /dev/null > /dev/tcp/host.docker.internal/25565' && echo "ok" || echo "failed"
```

- If you plan to install Lunar Client instead of using Prism, simply copy the Lunar installer or client files into `/home/developer` (or use the noVNC desktop browser to download within the container). The container now extracts AppImages automatically when FUSE is not available.

Use this code to start lunar client (run it in this terminal not the novnc)
docker exec -u developer novnc-ubuntu bash -lc 'export DISPLAY=:1; export XAUTHORITY=/home/developer/.Xauthority; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/developer/Applications/squashfs-root:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; export XDG_DATA_DIRS=/home/developer/Applications/squashfs-root/share:$XDG_DATA_DIRS; export LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1; nohup /home/developer/Applications/squashfs-root/lunarclient --no-sandbox --disable-gpu > /home/developer/lunar_run.log 2>&1 &'

Rolling snapshot helper
-----------------------
If the container may disconnect unexpectedly, a rolling snapshot helper is provided that keeps a short-lived filesystem image of the running container and deletes it after 10 minutes.

Scripts:

- `scripts/rolling_snapshot.sh` ‚Äî runs continuously, commits the running container to an image, saves a tar, waits 10 minutes, then deletes the image and tar and repeats. Use this if you want a short grace window to recover after an unexpected disconnect.

Run it (example):

```bash
# run in background (nohup) and log to /var/log/rolling_snapshot.log
nohup /workspaces/vmtest/scripts/rolling_snapshot.sh novnc-ubuntu novnc_rolling /var/backups 1 &
```

Notes:

- The helper commits filesystem state only (not in-memory process state). Restoring the image will preserve files and installed apps, but running processes will be restarted from image startup.
- The script may use notable disk space while saving tars; ensure `/var/backups` (or the chosen out_dir) has enough space and clean old backups if necessary.
- For true in-memory checkpoint/restore you'd need CRIU on the host and Docker support; contact me if you want a CRIU plan.

Sharing this repository

1. Push this repo to GitHub (example):

```bash
# create remote
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/vmtest.git
git push -u origin main
```

2. Your friends can then clone and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/vmtest.git
cd vmtest
docker compose up --build -d
open http://localhost:8080/vnc.html
```

Notes and caveats:
- This image runs a headless X server provided by Xvfb. It may not provide full GPU acceleration; performance depends on the host.
- For better OpenGL support, consider mapping the host GPU devices or using a docker image with GPU passthrough.
- The container runs a non-root user `developer`.
