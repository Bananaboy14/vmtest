Getting started

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose.
2. Clone the repo and run:

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd vmtest
docker compose up --build -d
```

3. Open the UI at `http://localhost:8080/vnc.html` (or use the port forwarded by your host).

Troubleshooting
- If the web UI says it cannot connect to the server, try opening the UI with the host parameter:

  `http://localhost:8080/vnc.html?host=localhost&port=8080`

- If you are loading vnc.html inside an HTTPS page, enable TLS in `docker-compose.yml` by setting `NOVNC_TLS=1` and rebuild.

Contributions
- Open a PR with improvements. If adding GPU passthrough instructions, include host platform notes.

GPU acceleration (optional)

If you have an NVIDIA GPU on the host and want much smoother Minecraft rendering, install the NVIDIA drivers and the nvidia-container-toolkit on the host and run the optional compose overlay:

```bash
# start with GPU enabled (requires nvidia-container-toolkit)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.gpu.yml up --build -d
```

Notes:
- The image does not include proprietary NVIDIA drivers â€” they must be present on the host.
- For Intel/AMD GPUs, you can try binding `/dev/dri` similarly and exposing the appropriate libraries; behavior varies by host.
