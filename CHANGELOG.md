## Technical Implementation Details

### **Persistence Architecture**
```
Web Interface (vnc.html) 
    ↓ WebSocket Connection
Node.js Proxy (port 8080)
    ↓ TCP Connection  
TigerVNC Server (port 5901)
    ↓ X11 Protocol
XFCE Desktop Environment
    ↓ Application Layer

    ├── VNC Server Health
    ├── Desktop Environment Status  
    ├── WebSocket Proxy Monitor
    ├── Application State Tracking
    └── System Resource Monitoring
```

### **Recovery Mechanisms**
1. **Connection Level**: Web interface auto-reconnection with backoff
2. **Service Level**: Session keeper restarts failed components
3. **Application Level**: Critical programs marked for auto-restart
4. **System Level**: Container health checks and restart policies

## Migration Notes

### **From Basic noVNC Setup**
- All existing functionality preserved
- Added persistence layer without breaking changes
- Enhanced interface is backward compatible
- Original VNC port (5901) still accessible

### **Configuration Updates**
- New persistent interface available at `/vnc.html`
- Session keeper automatically starts on container launch
- Application state preserved in `/tmp/` marker files
- Logs available in `/var/log/session-keeper.log`

## Future Roadmap

### **Planned Features (v1.1.0)**
- [ ] Multi-user session support
- [ ] Custom reconnection interval configuration
